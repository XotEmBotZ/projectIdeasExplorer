The railway wagons at such sidings are loaded through contractual means by payloader.\n\nThe loading of wagons by contractual arrangement often results in overloading or underloading Railway wagons. The rules of Penal overloading and underloading are notified by Railway. Any penalty for overloading charged by the Railway for any consignment is payable by the purchaser.\n\nHowever, in case of underloading of wagons, credit for idle freight is adjusted in coal bills. Thus any idle freight for under-loading is borne by CIL. During 2021-22, the expense for under-loading was nearly Rs.593 Cr. whereas the contract for wagon loading itself was only Rs.276 Cr.\n\nHence, a digital solution in the form of sensor\/ IoT is needed to prevent the under-loading and overloading of Railway wagons.","youtubeLink":"","datasetLink":"NA"},"SIH1315":{"title":"Development of a Telematic control unit for capturing vital data of\na vehicle without using company fitted telemetry data port.","category":"Hardware","organization":"Ministry of coal","domainBucket":"Smart Vehicles","submisions":12,"description":"Many businesses rely on telemetry data from vehicles to gain insights into their fleet's performance, driver behavior, and maintenance needs. However, in some scenarios, vehicles may not have a telemetry data port or the port may not be accessible due to limitations imposed by the vehicle manufacturer.\n\nThe challenge is to develop a Telematic Control Unit (TCU) that can capture essential vehicle data without relying on the company-fitted telemetry data port. The TCU should provide a robust and reliable method of collecting data from various sensors and systems within the vehicle, ensuring real-time monitoring and analysis capabilities for fleet management purposes.\n\nThe solution should address the following key aspects:\n\nData Capture: Develop a TCU that can interface with the vehicle's systems and sensors to capture vital data such as engine performance, payload, fuel consumption, speed, location, and diagnostic information. The TCU should be capable of extracting data accurately and reliably, regardless of the vehicle's make or model.\n\nWireless Connectivity: Implement a wireless communication mechanism for transmitting the captured data from the TCU to a centralized server or cloud platform. The solution should support a secure and robust wireless protocol that ensures data integrity and confidentiality.\n\nReal-time Monitoring and Analysis: Design a user-friendly dashboard or interface that allows fleet managers to monitor and analyze vehicle data in real time. The dashboard should provide insights into vehicle performance, payload, fuel efficiency, driver behavior, and maintenance needs, enabling businesses to make informed decisions and optimize their operations.\n\nCompatibility and Integration: Ensure that the TCU solution can be easily integrated with existing fleet management systems or third-party applications commonly used in the industry. The solution should provide APIs or other integration capabilities to enable seamless data exchange and interoperability.\n\nSecurity and Privacy: Implement strong security measures to protect the captured data from unauthorized access or tampering. The solution should adhere to industry best practices for data security and privacy, including encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, the proposed TCU solution should enable businesses to capture and leverage vital vehicle data without relying on the company-fitted telemetry data port. This will empower fleet managers to optimize fleet performance, reduce maintenance costs, enhance fuel efficiency, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. \nIt may also fetch data from a company-fitted telemetry port without opening the port in a non-invasive manner.","youtubeLink":"","datasetLink":"NA"},"SIH1325":{"title":"AI Assisted Tele-medicine KIOSK for Rural India","category":"Software","organization":"Government of Kerala","domainBucket":"Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development","submisions":55,"description":"Health care in rural India is still an unresolved area that demands improved and innovative solutions.

In essence, the root of this problem is not the number of children in a classroom but rather the inability for each child to receive adequate attention. Combining modern technology and 1:1 tuition, students could perform far beyond other students who were being taught in more conventional ways. By combining blended learning (where face-to-face teaching is combined with online learning) with real-time data, we can get rapid feedback in classrooms and use that feedback to further enhance the quality of education.\n\nAs an example, consider a classroom of 30 students. Ten students with similar abilities may work closely with the teacher, another ten may work through lectures and online tasks using computer terminals, and the final ten may work together on a group project. In the next lesson, students are rotated so they can learn in different ways throughout the course. This kind of approach enables the teacher to focus more closely on fewer children at once. The teacher can also tailor the learning approach for each student based on how well each one works for the individual. Meanwhile, the software on the computer is advanced enough to tailor the content to each student as well. By collecting real-time feedback on each child's results, the course contents can be adapted per student and make it as if they were receiving a one-on-one tuition. This approach allows each student to have their own learning path that's customized to their needs. By doing this, teachers can easily see which students are falling behind and offer more individualized teaching to those students.\n\nIf more schools were to adopt a similar approach, where some responsibilities could be handled by tech-aided learning methods, more of the teachers' time could be freed-up to give more attention where it's needed the most, even in larger classroom sizes. Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application's that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support education delivery effectiveness of students into educational ecosystem and generate insights based on data it collected.
